function enemyTurn(){
//after player turn: cycle through enemies on the battlefield. Ideally this will be quick and snappy
//enemy will move towards player unless already in attacking range
//if the enemy can attack after movement, the enemy will do so
//bonus: enemies will move just out of range of player if they cannot attack that turn. 
////Possibly smarter enemies can do this. Not priority due to time crunch
